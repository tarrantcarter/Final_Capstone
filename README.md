# Motivational Tweet Generator: Inspiration for the 21st century
What words are inspiring and motivating people in 2021? Is it quotes from people of the past? Is it original ideas from new thought leaders? There is currently no central hub or corpus for the topics and messages that are inspiring people today. My goal in this project is to find meaningful topics to filter about a million inspirational tweets. Once the tweets have been properly labeled, they will be fed into a motivational tweet generator where the user can choose their category of inspiration.
